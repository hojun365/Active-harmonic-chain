This github repository includes python code for estimating large deviation function of active work for actie Ornstin-Ulenbeck particle (AOUP). 
The first model is a single AOUP in harmonic potential (2-dimensional). 
The other model is interacting AOUPs with WCA(Weeks-Chandler-Andersen) potential (1-dimensional).

# Active harmonic chain model의 active work fluctuation
This repository contains a simulation code for estimationg active work fluctuation of active harmonic chain model via machine learning.
The estimation can be done by two methods. 
1) "main.py" for fully-connected neural network with deep Ritz method 
2) "equiv.py" for Set Attention Blocks (SABs).

Please note that the data structure (input data for neural networks) are totally different, so one cannot directly plug a neural network model based on SAB to "main.py".
